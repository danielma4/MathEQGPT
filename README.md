Inspired by a desire to learn more about famous mathematicians and their contributions to the history of mathematics (a good resource can be found [here](https://mathigon.org/timeline)). Leverages a quantized 7b Llama model for text completion, as well as querying a database of 8000+ mathematicians. Model can slow and hallucinates quite a bit, but still interesting to see Llama in action!
